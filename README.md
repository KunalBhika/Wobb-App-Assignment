# Wobb-App-Assignment

I recently completed an assessment from a company where I developed a Wobb app clone for the website as specified in the requirements. My primary focus was on building a fully functional frontend while integrating a basic backend with a login and signup system using JWT authentication. I redesigned the card components and ensured the application was fully responsive across all devices. The project was built using React.js and styled with Tailwind CSS, utilizing the Daisy UI plugin to enhance the UI design and improve user experience.

# Steps to Set Up on a Local Machine

# 1. Setup the frontend

Clone the Repository

git clone <repository_url>
cd <project_directory>

Navigate to the Frontend Folder and Install Dependencies

cd frontend
npm install

Run the Frontend

npm run dev

Access the Application

Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.


# 2. Setup the backend

Open another terminal

cd backend
npm install

Run your backend

npm run dev

Note : if backend does not connects to Database try restarting it again as MongoDb atlas sometimes take time to connect.

# Finally access the website on http://localhost:5173
